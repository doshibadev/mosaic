# Code of Conduct

## Our commitment

We want Mosaic to be a welcoming space for everyone. That means:
- Being respectful to everyone, even if you disagree
- No harassment, insults, or discrimination
- Assuming good intent
- Being helpful instead of gatekeeping

## What we won't tolerate

- Harassment based on identity, background, or beliefs
- Insults, name-calling, or personal attacks
- Spam or off-topic promotion
- Derailing discussions
- Sexual or violent content

## If someone breaks this

1. Tell them directly if you're comfortable doing so
2. If that doesn't work or you're not comfortable, report it privately
3. We'll investigate and take appropriate action

## Reporting violations

Email `conduct@getmosaic.run` with:
- What happened
- Who was involved
- When it happened
- Any links or evidence

We'll keep your identity private and handle it fairly.

## Scope

This applies to:
- GitHub issues and discussions
- Pull request comments
- Any Mosaic-affiliated spaces (Discord, etc)

## Enforcement

We'll give people a chance to improve. If someone repeatedly violates this, we'll remove them from the community.

## Questions?

This is a work in progress. If something isn't clear, ask.
