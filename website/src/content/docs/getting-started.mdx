# Getting Started

Mosaic is a modern package manager for Polytoria designed to be fast, secure, and developer-friendly. 

## Installation

Mosaic is currently distributed as a standalone binary or via Cargo.

### Via Cargo (Recommended)
```bash
cargo install mosaic
```

### Direct Download
You can download the latest binary for your operating system from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/doshibadev/mosaic/releases).

## Initialization

To start using Mosaic in your project, run the `init` command in your project root:

```bash
mosaic init
```

This will create a `mosaic.toml` file where you can manage your dependencies.

## Adding Packages

You can add packages directly from the Mosaic Registry:

```bash
mosaic add logger@0.1.0
```

Mosaic will automatically:
1. Resolve the version from `api.getmosaic.run`.
2. Download the package blob.
3. Inject the `ModuleScript` into your `.poly` environment file.
4. Update your `mosaic.toml`.

## Your First Publish

To share your own packages with the community:

1. **Login:** `mosaic login`
2. **Setup:** Ensure your `mosaic.toml` has a valid name and version.
3. **Publish:** `mosaic publish`

Your package will be instantly available on the Mosaic Registry.
