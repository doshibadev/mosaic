# Getting Started

Learn how to get up and running with Mosaic in minutes.

## Installation

Currently, Mosaic is in early development. You can install the CLI from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/doshibadev/mosaic.git
cd mosaic/cli
cargo install --path .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize your project

Go to your Polytoria project folder and run:

```bash
mosaic init
```

This will create a `mosaic.toml` file.

### 2. Install a package

Try installing the `logger` package:

```bash
mosaic install logger
```

### 3. Use the package in Lua

In your Polytoria script, you can now require the package:

```lua
local Logger = require(game.ScriptService.logger)
Logger.info("Hello from Mosaic!")
```
