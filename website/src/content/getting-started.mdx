# Getting Started

Learn how to get up and running with Mosaic in minutes.

## Installation

### Automated Install (Recommended)

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://getmosaic.run/install.ps1 | iex
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://getmosaic.run/install.sh | sh
```

### Build from Source

If you prefer to build from source (Rust required):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/doshibadev/mosaic.git
cd mosaic/cli
cargo install --path .
```

---

## Your First Project

### 1. Initialize

Navigate to your Polytoria project folder (where your `.poly` file is) and run:

```bash
mosaic init
```

This creates a `mosaic.toml` file:

```toml
[package]
name = "my-project"
version = "0.1.0"
```

### 2. Install a Package

Let's install a logging library.

```bash
mosaic install logger
```

Mosaic will:
1. Download the `logger` package.
2. Inject it into your `.poly` file under `ScriptService`.
3. Add it to `mosaic.toml`.

### 3. Use it in Code

Open your Polytoria project. You can now require the module just like any other:

```lua
-- The package is injected into ScriptService with its package name
local Logger = require(game.ScriptService.logger)

Logger:info("Hello from Mosaic!")
```
