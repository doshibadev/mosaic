# Introduction
 
Welcome to the Mosaic Documentation!

## What is Mosaic?

Mosaic is a package manager for **Polytoria**. It allows you to install, manage, and share Lua packages for your Polytoria projects with ease.

## Key Features

- **CLI-first workflow**: Manage your dependencies from the command line.
- **XML Injection**: Automatically adds ModuleScripts to your `.poly` files.
- **Secure Registry**: Packages are hosted securely and verified with SHA256 hashes.
- **Semantic Versioning**: (Coming Soon) robust version management.

## How it Works

Mosaic works by reading a `mosaic.toml` file in your project root and injecting the required packages into your Polytoria project's `ScriptService`.
