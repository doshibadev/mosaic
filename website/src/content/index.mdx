# Introduction

**Mosaic** is a modern package manager for [Polytoria](https://polytoria.com), a user-generated content platform.

## The Problem

Sharing code on Polytoria has traditionally been a manual process:
- Copy-pasting scripts from Discord or Forums.
- Manually dragging `ModuleScript` assets from the toolbox.
- losing track of versions and updates.
- "Dependency hell" when one script needs another.

## The Solution

Mosaic brings the developer experience of tools like `npm` or `cargo` to Polytoria:

- **📦 Dependency Management:** Declare packages in a simple `mosaic.toml` file.
- **🚀 One-Command Install:** `mosaic install` fetches everything you need.
- **🔒 Version Locking:** Ensure everyone on your team uses the exact same versions.
- **💉 Direct Injection:** Mosaic modifies your `.poly` project file directly—no manual dragging required.
